# mvp-ai-generation-orchestration
MVP for an app which orchestrates complex workflows from natural language using Local LLMs and Temporal.io.
This project is an AI-powered platform that enables users to generate, visualize, and execute durable workflows through a conversational interface. By leveraging a fine-tuned local Mistral model, it converts natural language prompts into structured workflows and executable code, which are then visualized in an interactive React Flow editor and orchestrated by Temporal.
